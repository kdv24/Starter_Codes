    <div class="intro">
        <p>I'm very excited to be submitting my application to Epicodus.  To host my information, I've created this site which includes links to my "Ping Pong" Test response, the gist of my Swift code, and my "Layout Test" page. If you have any questions for me, please <a href="tel:541-539-0439">call</a>, <a href="mailto:kdv@me.com?Subject=Epicodus Application" target="_top">email</a>, or follow the contact information on my linked <a href="#">r&eacutesum&eacute</a>.</p>

        <li><a href="PingPongwebsite.html" target="blank">Ping Pong</a></li>
        <p>For this assignment, the applicant is asked to design a web page where the user is prompted to enter a number, and then the page displays every number up to that number. But, for multiples of three, the page prints "ping" instead of the number, and for multiples of five, the page prints "pong". For numbers that are multiples of three and five, the page prints "ping-pong".</p>

        <li><a href="https://gist.github.com/kdv24/79be5ff544215d6c6097">Swift Ping Pong Gist</a></li>
        <p>I chose to complete the Ping Pong challenge using the new language, Swift.  Because I am currently learning Swift, it seemed like a good opportunity for me to meet the requirement for this application while also practicing my new language!  My code is shown in the attached Gist.</p>

      <div class="column"> 
        <li><a href="#">The Layout Test</a></li>
        <p>The challenge for the Layout Test is simply to make two versions of a given 2 column CSS layout.  One version must be completed using Bootstrap, and the other must be independently designed using one's own CSS.  In an ideal world, both are responsive, have stacked columns for mobile, and look pretty!</p>

          <p>Ya da ya da, just curious how this affects it</p>
